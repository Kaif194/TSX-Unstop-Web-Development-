      Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and
      web applications that are accessed through the internet. It involves three
      core technologies: HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling and
      layout, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior. Web
      development can range from building simple static web pages to complex,
      data-driven applications.
